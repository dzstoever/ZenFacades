THE CODE IS NOT PRODUCTION QUALITY, yet.
 
It currently: 
	1) configures a router dynamically, 
	2) makes it load-balance, 
	3) populates its routing table based on UDP discovery.


It needs:	
	1) an implementation of a peer to peer host class (alternative to UDP discovery).
	2) error handling
	3) endpoint cleanup
		- if a service does not respond, remove it from the routing list.
	4) support for multiple service contracts (currently supports IRemoteFacade)
	5) repository to store EndpointDiscoveryMetadata (shared between routers).
