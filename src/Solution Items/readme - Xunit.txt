/* [Xbehave.Scenario] Notes
 * - Seems to take a bit longer than a [Xunit.Fact]
 * - The number of tests is equal to 3 for each, so 1 [Scenario] = 3 passed/failed tests
 * - Console output is lost in Test window unless it is in a Given(), When(), or Then()  
 *	 but if using 'Test With > Debugger' messages are in the Debug window  */
